Targeting the microbiome-gut-brain axis for improving cognition in schizophrenia and major mood disorders: A narrative review.

Cognitive impairment has been consistently found to be a core feature of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder). In recent years, a great effort has been made in elucidating the biological causes of cognitive deficits and the search for new biomarkers of cognition. Microbiome and gut-brain axis (MGB) hormones have been postulated to be potential biomarkers of cognition in serious mental illnesses. The main aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the association of microbiome and gut-brain hormones on cognitive processes in schizophrenia and major mood disorders and the association of MGB hormones with stress and the immune system. Our review underscores the role of the MGB axis on cognitive aspects of serious mental illnesses with the potential use of agents targeting the gut microbiota as cognitive enhancers. However, the current evidence for clinical trials focused on the MGB axis as cognitive enhancers in these clinical populations is scarce. Future clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation need to consider potential mechanistic pathways such as the HPA axis, the immune system, or gut-brain axis hormones involved in appetite control and energy homeostasis.
