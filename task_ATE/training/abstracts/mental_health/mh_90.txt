Gut microbiota and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a multifactorial-mediated autoimmune orbital disease with the highest incidence of orbital disease in adults. Due to the complex clinical manifestations and prolonged course, TAO seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients. The pathogenesis of TAO has not been fully elucidated and the treatment lacks specificity. Therefore, in-depth research on the pathogenesis of TAO is to find effective treatments. In recent years, studies have suggested that there is gut microbiota disorder in TAO, and the risk factors of TAO can promote gut microbiota disorder. Disordered gut microbiota can participate in the occurrence and development of TAO via influencing T cell differentiation, mimicking autoantigens, and influencing host non-coding RNA expression. Modulating the gut microbiota also has therapeutic effects on TAO and is a promising therapeutic approach.
