Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Historical Overview and Future Directions.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease which is strongly associated with age. The incidence of ALS increases from the age of 40 and peaks between the ages of 65 and 70. Most patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis or lung infections within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms, dealing a huge blow to patients and their families. With aging populations, improved diagnostic methods and changes in reporting criteria, the incidence of ALS is likely to show an upward trend in the coming decades. Despite extensive researches have been done, the cause and pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In recent decades, large quantities of studies focusing on gut microbiota have shown that gut microbiota and its metabolites seem to change the evolvement of ALS through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, and in turn, the progression of ALS will exacerbate the imbalance of gut microbiota, thereby forming a vicious cycle. This suggests that further exploration and identification of the function of gut microbiota in ALS may be crucial to break the bottleneck in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Hence, the current review summarizes and discusses the latest research advancement and future directions of ALS and brain-gut-microbiota axis, so as to help relevant researchers gain correlative information instantly.
