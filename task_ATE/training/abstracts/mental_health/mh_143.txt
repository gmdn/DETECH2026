The Benefits of Prebiotics and Probiotics on Mental Health.

In individuals with depression and anxiety, the composition or alteration of their gut microbiota can significantly affect their psychological symptoms. Articles for this study were selected using PubMed and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) with the following search terms: "gut microbiota," "depression," "anxiety," "probiotics," and "prebiotics." These studies evaluated the composition of the gut microbiota and the decrease in symptoms of depression and anxiety due to treatment with probiotics and prebiotics. Only papers published after 2015 were included. There was a significant relationship between the composition and alteration of the gut microbiota and the presence or variation of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Treatment with probiotics or prebiotics improved the symptoms of these mental health conditions. This literature review examines how different prebiotics and probiotics affect mental health and how altering individuals' gut microbiota correlates with depression and anxiety. Treatment with probiotics or prebiotics may decrease the severity of these mental disorders by altering the gut microbiota.
