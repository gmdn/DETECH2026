Improving Mental Health for the Mother-Infant Dyad by Nutrition and the Maternal Gut Microbiome.

Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) have significant negative impacts on mother and child, yet treatments are limited. Adequate nutrition during the perinatal period is essential to maternal and infant health, including maternal mental health and the child's neurologic and neuropsychiatric development. Nutrition holds promise to improve prevention and treatment of PMAD. The ability to manipulate the gut microbiota composition and structure through host nutrition and to harness the gut microbes for improved individualized nutrition may be an important new direction for prevention and treatment of PMAD, thus improving the mental health of mother and child.
