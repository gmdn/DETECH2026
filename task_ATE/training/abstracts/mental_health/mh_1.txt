Effects of antipsychotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota: A systematic review.

Antipsychotics (APs) have been increasingly prescribed for psychiatric disorders from schizophrenia to disruptive behavioral conditions. These drugs have been associated with considerable side effects, such as weight gain, and increasing evidence has also indicated that its use impacts gut microbiota (GM), although this connection is still little understood. To assess APs effects on the GM of patients starting or ongoing treatment, a systematic review was carried out in PubMed and Scopus databases. Twelve articles were considered eligible for the review, which investigated the effects of risperidone (5 studies), quetiapine (3), amilsupride (1), olanzapine (1), and unspecified atypical drugs (2). Eleven reported changes in GM in response to APs, and associations between the abundance of bacterial groups and different metabolic parameters were described by most of them. However, the studies were noticeably heterogeneous considering design, methods, and results. In this way, the effects of APs on GM composition and diversity were inconclusive. Despite the uncertain interactions, a more comprehensive understanding on how microbiota is affected by APs may help to optimize treatment, potentially minimizing side effects and improving adherence to treatment.
