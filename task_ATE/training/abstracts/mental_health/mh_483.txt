Abnormalities of the composition of the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in mice after splenectomy.

The brain-gut-microbiota axis is a complex multi-organ bidirectional signaling system between the brain and microbiota that participates in the host immune system. The spleen, as the largest immune organ in the body, has a key role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Here, we investigated whether splenectomy could affect depression-like phenotypes and the composition of the gut microbiota in adult mice. In behavioral tests, splenectomy did not cause depression-like behaviors in mice. Conversely, splenectomy led to significant alterations in the diversity of gut microbes compared with the findings in control (no surgery) and sham-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the boxplots representing the splenectomy group were distant from those representing the other two groups. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the splenectomy group at the taxonomic level compared with the other two groups. Finally, splenectomy induced significant changes in lactic acid and n-butyric acid levels compared with those in the other groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the counts of certain bacteria and lactic acid (or n-butyric acid) levels in all groups. These data suggest that splenectomy leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota. It is likely that the spleen-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the composition of the gut microbiota by regulating immune homeostasis.
