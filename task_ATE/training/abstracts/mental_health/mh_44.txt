Exploring environmental exposomes and the gut-brain nexus: Unveiling the impact of pesticide exposure.

This review delves into the escalating concern of environmental pollutants and their profound impact on human health in the context of the modern surge in global diseases. The utilisation of chemicals in food production, which results in residues in food, has emerged as a major concern nowadays. By exploring the intricate relationship between environmental pollutants and gut microbiota, the study reveals a dynamic bidirectional interplay, as modifying microbiota profile influences metabolic pathways and subsequent brain functions. This review will first provide an overview of potential exposomes and their effect to gut health. This paper is then emphasis the connection of gut brain function by analysing microbiome markers with neurotoxicity responses. We then take pesticide as example of exposome to elucidate their influence to biomarkers biosynthesis pathways and subsequent brain functions. The interconnection between neuroendocrine and neuromodulators elements and the gut-brain axis emerges as a pivotal factor in regulating mental health and brain development. Thus, manipulation of gut microbiota function at the onset of stress may offer a potential avenue for the prevention and treatment for mental disorder and other neurodegenerative illness.
