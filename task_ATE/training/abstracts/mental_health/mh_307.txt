The clinical and mechanistic roles of bile acids in depression, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.

The burden of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on human health and social economy worldwide. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidences have implicated that bile acids (BAs) are involved in the onset and progression of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we summarized recent studies of BAs in three types of highly prevalent brain disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. The shared and specific BA profiles were explored and potential markers associated with disease development and progression were summarized. The mechanistic roles of BAs were reviewed with focuses on inflammation, gut-brain-microbiota axis, cellular apoptosis. We also discussed future perspectives for the prevention and treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by targeting BAs and related molecules and gut microbiota. Our understanding of BAs and their roles in brain disorders is still evolving. A large number of questions still need to be addressed on the emerging crosstalk among central, peripheral, intestine, and their contribution to brain and mental health.
