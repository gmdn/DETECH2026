Psychobiotics in diet: significance and applications of neuroactive and psychoactive microbial metabolites.

The brain governs psychiatric behavior of an individual by regulating certain neuroactive compounds produced within the body. These might also be produced by the microbes present in the gut, along with certain probiotic strains: the psychobiotics. A healthy diet including psychobiotics plays an important role in neurological functioning by producing a number of psychoactive compounds. Health benefits of probiotic microorganisms to the host and their psychoactive metabolites involved in the alternation of brain functioning are summarized in this article. The effect of diet on gut microbiota is highlighted, along with the possibility of probiotic bacteria as psychobiotics in the treatment or prevention of mental health-related disorders. The psychobiotic formulations seem to be a step toward precision probiotics development.
