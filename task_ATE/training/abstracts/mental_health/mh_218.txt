Disrupted diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in patients with alcohol dependence.

BACKGROUND: Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) can exhibit gut dysbacteria. Dysbacteria may co-occur with disruptions of circadian rhythmicity of the gut flora, which can aggravate AD. Herein, this study aimed to investigate diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in AD patients.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AD, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Fecal samples at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 7:00 PM were collected from each subject. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to characterize alterations and oscillations of the gut microbiota.
RESULTS: We found that β-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients oscillated diurnally compared with healthy subjects (p = 0.01). Additionally, 0.66% of operational taxonomic units oscillated diurnally in AD patients versus 1.68% in healthy subjects. At different taxonomic levels, bacterial abundance oscillated diurnally in both groups, such as Pseudomonas and Prevotella pallens (all p < 0.05). β-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients with high daily alcohol consumption, high-level cravings, short AD durations, and mild withdrawal symptoms oscillated diurnally compared with other AD patients (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The gut microbiota in AD patients exhibits disruptions of diurnal oscillation, which may provide novel insights into mechanisms of AD and the development of therapeutic strategies.
