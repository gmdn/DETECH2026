Microbial Reprogramming in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Review of Gut-Brain Communication and Emerging Evidence.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbial composition, has been associated with various health conditions, including mental health disorders, autism, and inflammatory diseases. While the exact mechanisms underlying OCD remain unclear, this review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and the multifaceted etiology of OCD, interacting with genetic, neurobiological, immunological, and environmental factors. This review highlights the emerging evidence implicating the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of OCD and its potential as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. We propose a model that positions dysbiosis as the central unifying element in the neurochemical, immunological, genetic, and environmental factors leading to OCD. The potential and challenges of microbial reprogramming strategies, such as probiotics and fecal transplants in OCD therapeutics, are discussed. This review raises awareness of the importance of adopting a holistic approach that considers the interplay between the gut and the brain to develop interventions that account for the multifaceted nature of OCD and contribute to the advancement of more personalized approaches.
