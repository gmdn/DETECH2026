Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Gut Microbiome and Mental Health via the Gut-Brain Axis.

Over the last few years, the microbiome has emerged as a high-priority research area to discover missing links between brain health and gut dysbiosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the commensal gut microbiome is an important regulator of the gut-brain axis and plays a critical role in brain physiology. Engaging microbiome-generated metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, the immune system, the enteric nervous system, the endocrine system (including the HPA axis), tryptophan metabolism or the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in communication between the gut microbes and the brain. Humans are exposed to a wide range of pollutants in everyday life that impact our intestinal microbiota and manipulate the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, resulting in predisposition to psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, the interaction between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity has yet to be completely investigated. Although research into the precise processes of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is growing rapidly, comprehending the implications of environmental contaminants remains challenging. In these milieus, we herein discuss how various environmental pollutants such as phthalates, heavy metals, Bisphenol A and particulate matter may alter the intricate microbiota-gut-brain axis thereby impacting our neurological and overall mental health.
