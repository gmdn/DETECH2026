Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease: Triggers, Mechanisms, and Immunotherapies.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease involving multiple etiologies and pathogenesis, in which neuroinflammation is a common factor. Both preclinical experiments and clinical studies provide evidence for the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of PD, although there are a number of key issues related to neuroinflammatory processes in PD that remain to be addressed. In this review, we highlight the relationship between the common pathological mechanisms of PD and neuroinflammation, including aggregation of α-synuclein, genetic factors, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut microbiome dysbiosis. We also describe the two positive feedback loops initiated in PD after the immune system is activated, and their role in the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, the interconnections and differences between the central and peripheral immune systems are discussed. Finally, we review the latest progress in immunotherapy research for PD patients, and propose future directions for clinical research.
