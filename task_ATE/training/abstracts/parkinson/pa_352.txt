Gut microbiome, short-chain fatty acids, alpha-synuclein, neuroinflammation, and ROS/RNS: Relevance to Parkinson's disease and therapeutic implications.

In this review, we explore how short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiome affect Parkinson's disease (PD) through their modulatory interactions with alpha-synuclein, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). In particular, SCFAs-such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate-are involved in gut-brain communication and can modulate alpha-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD. The gut microbiome of patients with PD has lower levels of SCFAs than healthy individuals. Probiotics may be a potential strategy to restore SCFAs and alleviate PD symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Also in this review, we discuss how alpha-synuclein, present in the guts and brains of patients with PD, may induce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress via ROS/RNS. Alpha-synuclein is considered an early biomarker for PD and may link the gut-brain axis to the disease pathogenesis. Therefore, elucidating the role of SCFAs in the gut microbiome and their impact on alpha-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation in microglia and on ROS/RNS is crucial in PD pathogenesis and treatment.
