Association between increased and decreased gut microbiota abundance and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and subgroup meta-analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to systematically investigate the association between gut microbiota (GM) abundance and Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and other literature datebase platforms were searched for eligible studies in the English-language from conception to March 1, 2024. Studies evaluating the association between GM and PD were included. The results of the included studies were analyzed using a random effects model with calculation of the mean difference (MD) with the 95 % confidence interval to quantify the incidence of differences in abundance of various bacterial families in PD patients. Continuous models were used to analyze the extracted data.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 1045 PD cases and 821 healthy controls were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. All the included studies exhibited reasonable quality. The included studies reported the data on the ratios of 10 families of GM. Of these 10 microbiota families, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Christensenellaceae were found to have increased ratios according to the pooled ratios, while Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Faecalibacterium were decreased in PD cases.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the PD cohort exhibited distinctive microbiota compositions compared to healthy individuals, with unique differential patterns in gut microbiome abundance at the phylum, family, and genus levels that may be associated wtih PD pathogenesis.
