Microbiome influences on neuro-immune interactions in neurodegenerative disease.

Mounting evidence points to a role for the gut microbiome in a wide range of central nervous system diseases and disorders including depression, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, immune system involvement has also been implicated in these diseases, specifically with inflammation being central to their pathogenesis. In addition to the reported changes in gut microbiome composition and altered immune states in many neurological diseases, how the microbiome and the immune system interact to influence disease onset and progression has recently garnered much attention. This chapter provides a review of the literature related to gut microbiome influences on neuro-immune interactions with a particular focus on neurological diseases. Gut microbiome-derived mediators, including short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites, lipopolysaccharide, and neurotransmitters, and their impact on neuro-immune interactions as well as routes by which these interactions may occur are also discussed.
