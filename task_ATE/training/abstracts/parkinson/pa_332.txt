Effects of microbiome-based interventions on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by neuronal damage and progressive loss of neuron function. Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, biotics, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the GM in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the meta-analysis showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD, - 0.57; 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.21; I2 = 42%; P = 0.002) with a qualitative trend of improvement in constipation. However, current studies have high methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes, requiring more well-designed and controlled studies to elucidate the complex linkage between microbiome, microbiome-modulating interventions, and NDDs.
