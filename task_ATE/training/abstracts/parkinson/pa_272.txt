Overview of the Gut Microbiome.

The human gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of microorganisms-collectively referred to as the gut microbiome-that maintain a symbiotic relationship with their host. This diverse community of microbes grows and changes as we do, with developmental, lifestyle, and environmental factors all shaping microbiome community structure. Increasing evidence suggests this relationship is bidirectional, with the microbiome also influencing host physiological processes. For example, changes in the gut microbiome have been shown to alter neurodevelopment and have lifelong effects on the brain and behavior. Age-related changes in gut microbiome composition have also been linked to inflammatory changes in the brain, perhaps increasing susceptibility to neurological disease. Indeed, associations between gut dysbiosis and many age-related neurological diseases-including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-have been reported. Further, microbiome manipulation in animal models of disease highlights a potential role for the gut microbiome in disease development and progression. Although much remains unknown, these associations open up an exciting new world of therapeutic targets, potentially allowing for improved quality of life for a wide range of patient populations.
