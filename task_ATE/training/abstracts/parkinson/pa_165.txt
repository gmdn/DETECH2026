Emerging insights between gut microbiome dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease: Pathogenic and clinical relevance.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, of which gastrointestinal disturbance appears prior to motor symptoms. Numerous studies have shed light on the roles of gastrointestinal tract and its neural connection to brain in PD pathology. In the past decades, the fields of microbiology and neuroscience have become ever more entwined. The emergence of gut microbiome has been considered as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function. With the advent of multi-omics sequencing techniques, gut microbiome of PD patients has been shown unique characteristics. The resident gut microbiota can exert considerable effects in PD and there are suggestions of a link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD progression. In this review, we summarize the latest progresses of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis, further highlight the clinical relevance of gut microbiota and its metabolites in both the non-motor and motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we draw attention to the complex interplay between gut microbiota and PD drugs, with the purpose of improving drug efficacy and prescription accordingly. Further studies at specific strain level and longitudinal prospective clinical trials using optimized methods are still needed for the development of diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic regimens for PD.
