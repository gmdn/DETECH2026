Crosstalk between gut microbiome and neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has become a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting the quality of life in people living with HIV (PLWH). Despite an established association between HAND and neuroinflammation induced by HIV proteins (gp120, Tat, Rev., Nef, and Vpr), the pathogenesis of HAND remains to be fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the gut microbiome is emerging as a critical regulator of various neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), suggesting that the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation may contribute to the development of these diseases, for example, gut dysbiosis and microbiota-derived metabolites can trigger inflammation in the brain. However, the potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of HAND remains largely unexplored. In this review, we aim to discuss and elucidate the HAND pathogenesis correlated with gut microbiome and neuroinflammation, and intend to explore the probable intervention strategies for HAND.
