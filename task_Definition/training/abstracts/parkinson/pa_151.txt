Introduction: Unraveling the complex contributions of indigenous microbes to neurological health and disease.

The complex interactions between the human body and its indigenous microbes have come into focus as key mediators of neurological health. With both established and emerging association studies, alterations to the gut microbiome are observed to co-occur with many neurological diseases. Whether these associations are due to microbiome-mediated contributions to human health or an effect of the neurological disease itself is largely unknown across conditions. Here, we have collected contributions from a broad group of experts that highlight gut microbiome impacts across numerous neurological conditions. Ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders, to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, traumatic injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, we hope to provide a clearer picture of how our indigenous microbes impact neurological health. The study of these indigenous microbes will continue to reveal critical mechanisms that may 1 day be exploited for therapeutic benefits against these recalcitrant diseases.
