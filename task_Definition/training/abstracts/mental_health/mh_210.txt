Brain, Gut, and Immune Interconnections in Psychiatric Disorders: Implications for Treatment.

Recent studies have linked the gut microbiota to psychiatric symptoms and disorders through complex bidirectional networks. The purpose of the current article is to describe the associations between the gut microbiota and brain in psychiatric disorders. Although there are no approved treatments, there are global efforts underway to find more accurate measures to guide treatment and research. In this brief review, we describe current conceptualizations regarding the complex interconnections between psychiatric disorders and the gut microbiota.
