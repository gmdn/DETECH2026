Retracted: Exploring the microbiome and mindfulness connection.

Mental health and its impact on overall well-being is a topic that is at the forefront of consideration in most industrialized countries. Ironically in the expansive world of the microbiome, gut microbes are most affected by modern, fast paced, westernized lifestyles, indicating a significant correlation based on geography, and physical and mental habits. The gut–brain axis is an established axis demonstrating the effect of the gut microbiota on the biochemical processes in the brain. With the existence of mindfulness initiatives such as adoption of a ‘yogic lifestyle’ aimed at creating a sense of harmony and balance within the individual, this special report considers the available evidence base, asking whether the harmony created by adopting this lifestyle can be related to establishing harmony in the gut–brain axis. In current times, mental health has been given much significance for the overall health of the individual. The microbiome provides a new gateway to approach mental health through the gut via the established gut–brain axis. This opinion article explores the current evidence establishing the strong gut–brain connection. We discuss the impact of lifestyle, yoga and mindfulness in balancing and creating mental health based on this data.
